# Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python
 
This course is the introduction to information visualization basics, with a focus on reporting and charting using the matplotlib library. The course includes designing information from representatino perspective, touching on what makes a good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate into in terms of visualizations. Then it helps in visualizations in python, matplotlib, and the best practices when creating basic charts and how to realize design decisions in the framework. This course includes tutorial of functionality available in matplotlib, and demonstrate a variety of basic statistical charts helping learners to identify when a particular method is good for a particular problem. 

In this repository all the required files are present to perform all the data manipulation tasks. All the items are defined as below
